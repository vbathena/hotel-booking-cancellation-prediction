### Developing a Predictive Model for Hotel Booking Cancellations

**Author:** Vijay Bathena

#### Executive summary
This project aims to build a machine learning model that can predict whether a hotel booking will be canceled or not, based on various features such as lead time, arrival date, deposit type, customer type, etc. The model can help hotel managers to estimate the net demand and plan accordingly. It can also help customers to find the best deals and avoid cancellation fees. The project also explores the data analysis and visualization of the hotel booking data, and evaluates the performance of different machine learning algorithms.

#### Rationale
Hotel booking cancellations can have a significant impact on the revenue and profitability of hotels, as well as on the customer satisfaction and loyalty. According to a study by [revenue hub](https://revenue-hub.com/cancellations-rates-where-do-they-stand-and-how-to-overcome-them/), the average cancellation rate of hotel bookings is around 40%, which means that almost half of the bookings are not realized. This poses a challenge for hotel managers to optimize their occupancy rate, inventory and pricing strategies, as well as to provide a better service to their customers.

#### Research Question
    
**The main research question of this project is:**

How can we use machine learning to predict hotel booking cancellations, and what are the most influential factors that affect the cancellation probability?

**Some sub-questions are:**

- Which machine learning algorithm performs the best in predicting hotel booking cancellations?
- How can we improve the accuracy and interpretability of the machine learning model?

#### Data Sources
The data source for this project is the Hotel Booking Demand dataset from Kaggle, which contains information about 119,390 hotel bookings from two different hotels in Portugal: a city hotel and a resort hotel. The dataset has 32 variables, including categorical, numerical, and date features. The target variable is *is_canceled*, which indicates whether the booking was canceled (1) or not (0).

#### Methodology
The methodology of this project consists of the following steps:

- Data Understanding: This step involves exploring the data's characteristics, including its shape, size, and columns. Understanding the meaning of each column and its relevance to the analysis. Identifying and addressing data issues like missing values, outliers, or errors.
- Data cleaning and preprocessing: This step involves handling missing values, outliers, duplicates, and data types.
- Exploratory data analysis and visualization: This step involves exploring the distribution and relationship of the variables, and creating visualizations to gain insights from the data.
- Feature engineering and selection: This step involves creating new features from the existing ones, and selecting the most relevant features for the machine learning model.
- Model building and evaluation: This step involves splitting the data into train and test sets, applying different machine learning algorithms, and evaluating their performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- Model interpretation and improvement: This step involves interpreting the results of the machine learning model, and applying techniques such as hyperparameter tuning, cross-validation, and feature importance analysis to improve the model.

#### Results
The results of this project are summarized as follows:

- The main factors that influence hotel booking cancellations are lead time, deposit type, country, market segment, and customer type.
- The best performing machine learning algorithm in predicting hotel booking cancellations is the Random Forest Classifier, achieving an accuracy of 88.2%, a precision of 88.2%, a recall of 88.2%, and an F1-score of 88% on the test set.
- The machine learning model can be improved by using more data, applying more feature engineering, and exploring more advanced machine learning techniques.


- The most important features that influenced the cancellation probability were lead time, deposit type, country, market segment, and previous cancellations.
- The model was able to identify some patterns and trends in the data, such as:
- The cancellation rate was higher for city hotels than for resort hotels.
- The cancellation rate was higher for bookings made through online travel agents than for direct bookings.
- The cancellation rate was higher for bookings with non-refundable deposits than for bookings with no deposits.
- The cancellation rate was higher for bookings from certain countries, such as Portugal, Spain, Brazil, China, etc.
- The cancellation rate was higher for bookings with longer lead times, longer stays, lower average daily rates, and fewer special requests.

#### Next steps
The next steps for this project are:

- Conduct a cost-benefit analysis of the machine learning model, and estimate the potential revenue increase and customer satisfaction improvement by using the model.
- To make the model more robust and generalizable, more data from different hotels and locations could be used, and the model could be validated on new and unseen data.
- To make the model more useful and actionable, the model could be deployed as a web application or a dashboard, where hotel managers and customers can input their booking details and get the cancellation probability and some recommendations.
